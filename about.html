            <h2>About this program</h2>
            <h3>Investment</h3>
            <p>We offer initial funding of approximately $500,000 in return for equity, typically around 7% of the company, to help startups get off the ground and navigate their early growth phases.

            <h2>Goal of the program</h2>
            <p>The main mission of Ekara Financials is to help startups launch and grow successfully. When companies come to Ekara Financials, they’re at various stages—some are just getting started, while others may already be a year or more into their journey. Regardless of their starting point, the objective is to ensure they are significantly stronger and more prepared after three months of support.

                For most startups, becoming "stronger" means developing a more refined product with an expanded user base and exploring more pathways to secure funding.
                
                Every startup, regardless of its maturity, gains from the dynamic, focused environment at Ekara Financials. Intensity is perhaps the best word to capture the experience—three months dedicated entirely to building and refining startups. Everyone involved, including Ekara’s team, other founders in the cohort, alumni, guest speakers, and potential investors, is committed to each startup’s growth. This supportive, highly driven environment cultivates strong motivation, the exact energy needed to tackle the challenges of launching a company.
                
                Many founders see the 11 weeks leading up to Demo Day as the most productive time in their entrepreneurial journeys. Although Ekara Financials continues its support beyond the initial three-month period, and the alumni network remains a powerful resource, those 11 weeks hold a unique significance. While people can’t be molded into something they’re not, the right environment can unlock their full potential. Many are often surprised at what they’re capable of achieving.
