            <h2>How to apply?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>If you want to apply, please submit your <a href="apply2.html">application</a> online.</li>
                <li>
                    People who apply before the regular deadline will hear back by December 18. If you apply after the deadline, we’ll still consider the application but can't promise exactly when we’ll get back to you.
                </li>
                <li>We encourage you to submit your application as soon as you’re ready to apply.</li>
                <li>
                    If your application is promising, we will invite you to interview with us. Most interviews will be held by video conference in November and early December. We typically make decisions the same day as your interview, and we give everyone who interviews detailed feedback on our decision.
                </li>
                <li>We invest in companies as soon as they are accepted; we do not wait for the batch to start.</li>

            <h2>Goal of the program</h2>
            <p>The main mission of Ekara Financials is to help startups launch and grow successfully. When companies come to Ekara Financials, they’re at various stages—some are just getting started, while others may already be a year or more into their journey. Regardless of their starting point, the objective is to ensure they are significantly stronger and more prepared after three months of support.

                For most startups, becoming "stronger" means developing a more refined product with an expanded user base and exploring more pathways to secure funding.
                
                Every startup, regardless of its maturity, gains from the dynamic, focused environment at Ekara Financials. Intensity is perhaps the best word to capture the experience—three months dedicated entirely to building and refining startups. Everyone involved, including Ekara’s team, other founders in the cohort, alumni, guest speakers, and potential investors, is committed to each startup’s growth. This supportive, highly driven environment cultivates strong motivation, the exact energy needed to tackle the challenges of launching a company.
                
                Many founders see the 11 weeks leading up to Demo Day as the most productive time in their entrepreneurial journeys. Although Ekara Financials continues its support beyond the initial three-month period, and the alumni network remains a powerful resource, those 11 weeks hold a unique significance. While people can’t be molded into something they’re not, the right environment can unlock their full potential. Many are often surprised at what they’re capable of achieving.
